// 7kyu - Shortest Code: Jumping Dutch Act

// Shortest Code : Jumping Dutch act
// (Code length limit: 90 chars)

// This is the challenge version of coding 3min series. If you feel difficult, please complete the simple version

// Task:
// Mr. despair wants to jump off Dutch act, So he came to the top of a building.

// Scientific research shows that a man jumped from the top of the roof, when the floor more than 6, the person will often die in an instant; When the floor is less than or equal to 6, the person will not immediately die, he would scream. (without proof)

// Input: floor, The height of the building (floor)

// Output: a string, The voice of despair(When jumping Dutch act)

// Example:
// sc(2) should return "Aa~ Pa! Aa!"

// It means:

// Mr. despair jumped from the 2 floor, the voice is "Aa~"
// He fell on the ground, the voice is "Pa!"
// He did not die immediately, and the final voice was "Aa!"
// sc(6) should return "Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Pa! Aa!"

// sc(7) should return "Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Pa!"

// sc(10) should return "Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Aa~ Pa!"

// if floor<=1, Mr. despair is safe, return ""

// Code length calculation
// In javascript, we can't get the user's real code, we can only get the system compiled code. Code length calculation is based the compiled code.

// For example:

// If you typed sc=x=>x+1
// after compile, it will be:sc=function(x){return x+1;}

// The final advice
// Just play in this kata, Don't experiment in real life ;-)

let sc = f => f > 1 ? Array(f).join("Aa~ ") + "Pa!" + (f < 7 ? " Aa!" : "") : "";
