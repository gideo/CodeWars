// 7kyu - Chuck Norris II - One Punch 

// Chuck Norris is the world's toughest man - he once kicked a horse in the chin. Its descendants today are known as giraffes.

// Like his punches, Chuck NEVER needs more than one line of code.

// Your task, to please Chuck, is to create a function that chains 4 methods on a SINGLE LINE! You can pass with multiple lines, but CHuck will pity you. Go big or go home. ONE LINE!!

// Chuck expects his list of favourite items to be split, sorted, joined AND have any occurrences of the letters 'e' and 'a' removed - why, you ask? Well Nunchuks hasn't got the letters 'a' or 'e' in it has it?? Chuck says shut your mouth... and don't forget the capitals.

// If anyone dares to provide Chuck with an empty string, an integer or an array, just return a description of their face once Chuck finds out: 'Broken!'

// Go, go go!!!

let onePunch = items => (items.length == 0 || typeof(items) != "string") ? "Broken!" : items.split(" ").sort().join(" ").replace(/[ae]/gi, "");
