// 7kyu - Coding Meetup #6 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Can they code in the same language?

// You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

// Your task is to return either:

// true if all developers in the list code in the same language; or
// false otherwise.
// For example, given the following input array:

// var list1 = [
//   { firstName: 'Daniel', lastName: 'J.', country: 'Aruba', continent: 'Americas', age: 42, language: 'JavaScript' },
//   { firstName: 'Kseniya', lastName: 'T.', country: 'Belarus', continent: 'Europe', age: 22, language: 'JavaScript' },
//   { firstName: 'Hanna', lastName: 'L.', country: 'Hungary', continent: 'Europe', age: 65, language: 'JavaScript' },
// ];
// your function should return true.

// Notes:

// The strings representing a given language will always be formatted in the same way (e.g. 'JavaScript' will always be formatted will upper-case 'J' and 'S'
// The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.




// This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.

  return list.every(e => e.language === list[0].language);
