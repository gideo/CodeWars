// 6kyu - Encrypt This! 

// Acknowledgments:
// I thank yvonne-liu for the idea and for the example tests :)

// Description:
// Encrypt this!

// You want to create secret messages which can be deciphered by the Decipher this! kata. Here are the conditions:

// Your message is a string containing space separated words.
// You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
// The first letter needs to be converted to its ASCII code.
// The second letter needs to be switched with the last letter
// Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in input.
// Examples:
// encryptThis("Hello") === "72olle"
// encryptThis("good") === "103doo"
// encryptThis("hello world") === "104olle 119drlo"

let encryptThis = text => text.replace(/\b\w(\w?)(\w*?)(\w?)\b/g, (word, a, mid, b) => word.charCodeAt(0) + b + mid + a);
