// 6kyu - Image Host Filename Generator

// You are developing an image hosting website.

// You have to create a function for generating random and unique image filenames.

// Create a function for generating a random 6 character string which will be used to access the photo URL.

// To make sure the name is not already in use, you are given access to an PhotoManager object.

// You can call it like so to make sure the name is unique

// // at this point, the website has only one photo, hosted on the 'ABCDEF' url
// photoManager.nameExists('ABCDEF'); // returns true
// photoManager.nameExists('BBCDEF'); // returns false
// Note: We consider two names with same letters but different cases to be unique.
