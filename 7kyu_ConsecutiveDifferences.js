// 7kyu - Consecutive Differences 

// Given a list of integers, find the positive difference between each consecutive pair of numbers, and put this into a new list of differences. Then, find the differences between consecutive pairs in this new list, and repeat until the list has a length of 1. Then, return the single value.

// The list will only contain integers, and will not be empty.

// For example:

// differences([1, 2, 3]) => [1, 1] => [0] -> 0
// differences([1, 5, 2, 7, 8, 9, 0]) => [4, 3, 5, 1, 1, 9] => [1, 2, 4, 0, 8] => .. => 1
// differences([2, 3, 1]) => [1, 2] => [1] => 1

function differences(a) {
  while(a.length > 1) {
    for(let i = 0; i < a.length - 1; i++) {
      a[i] = Math.abs(a[i] - a[i + 1]);
    }
    a.length = a.length - 1;
  }
  return a[0];
}
