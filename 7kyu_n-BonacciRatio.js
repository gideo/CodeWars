// 7kyu - n-Bonacci Ratio 

// The n-Bonacci Ratio
// The Fibonacci sequence is the sequence that starts with 0, 1 that increases by the previous two terms added together each time.
// In mathematical terms:
// F(0) = 0	F(1) = 1	F(x) = F(x-1) + F(x-2)
// As the number of terms approaches infinity, the ratio between the last term and the term before that approaches a constant. This is known as the golden ratio. It is approximately equal to 1.61803.
// There is another sequence called the Pell Sequence (or the two-bonacci sequence), which is very similar to the Fibonacci sequence:
// P(0) = 0	P(1) = 1	P(x) = 2 * P(x-1) + P(x-2)
// The ratio between the last two numbers as the length of the sequence approaches infinity also approaches a constant: approximately 2.4142. This is known as the silver ratio.
// Your job is to find the n-bonacci ratio as the number of terms approaches infinity, where the n-bonacci sequence is defined as:
// n-bonacci(0) = 0	n-bonacci(1) = 1	n-bonacci(x) = n * n-bonacci(x-1) + n-bonacci(x-2)
// This value must be precise to at least 8 decimal places.
