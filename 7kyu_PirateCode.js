// 7kyu - Pirate Code 

// Take a look at this pirate game.

// Give Amaro an array to confirm his logic for the next time, when the number of pirates changes.

// Keep in mind that each time the pirates find a treasure, the amount of gold equals to the number of pirates * 20.

// Example:

// If number of pirates is 2, including Amaro, then array = [40, 0], So he can keep all of the gold to himself.

// If number of pirates is 3, including Amaro, then array = [59, 0, 1], and 59 gold is his for the taking.

// If number of pirates is 4, including Amaro, then array = [79, 0, 1, 0], and 79 gold is his to take.

// If number of pirates is 5, including Amaro, then array = [98, 0, 1, 0, 1], and 98 gold is his for the taking.
