// 7kyu - Harvest Festival 

// You have cultivated a plant, and after months of hard work, the time has come to reap the flowers of your hard work. When it was growing, you added water and fertilizer, and kept a constant temperature. It's time check how much your plant has grown.

// A plant is represented horizontally, from the base to the left, to the end to the right:

// ---@---@---@
// The stem is represented by hyphens -, and the flowers are represented by symbols. A plant always starts with the stem, and always ends with flowers.

// Four parameters will be given. The four parameters are:

// seed (string) - determines the type of flowers generated by the plant.
// water (integer) - each unit of water extends the portion of stem between the flowers. It also gives how many times the stems + flower clusters should be repeated
// fert (integer) - each unit of fertilizer increases the amount of flowers, grouped in clusters
// temp (integer) - if the temperature given is in the range of 20째C and 30째C, the plant grows normally, otherwise, all the flowers die except for one flower at the end of the stem.
// Given the above parameters, your task is to return a string representing the plant.

// Examples
// plant("@", 3, 3, 25) => "---@@@---@@@---@@@"
// # Water gives the length of the stem portions between flowers
// # Water also gives the total number of segments(number of times flowers + stems should be repeated)
// # Fertilizer gives the length of the flower clusters.
// # Temperature is in the range of 20째C and 30째C

// plant("$", 4, 2, 30) => "----$$----$$----$$----$$"

// plant("&", 1, 5, 20) => "-&&&&&"

// plant("^", 3, 3, 35) => "---------^"
// # The temperature is not in the correct range, so all flowers die, except the last one at the end.
// # The stem is not affected by the temperature
// Notes
// Edge conditions will not be tested, meaning parameters of water or fertilizer or temperature being zero. This will not be tested. The parameters will always be valid (no zero).
// The temperature bounds are inclusive (20 and 30 will be included as 21, 22, 23, 24...)
// Happy Coding!

let plant = (seed, water, fert, temp) => temp < 20 || temp > 30 
    ? `${"-".repeat(water ** 2)}${seed}`
    : `${"-".repeat(water)}${seed.repeat(fert)}`.repeat(water);
