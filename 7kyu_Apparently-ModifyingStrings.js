// 7kyu - Apparently-Modifying Strings 

// For every string, after every occurrence of 'and' and/or 'but', insert the substring 'apparently' directly after the occurrence(s).

// If input does not contain 'and' or 'but', return the same string. If a blank string, return ''.

// If substring 'apparently' is already directly after an 'and' and/or 'but', do not add another. (Do not add duplicates).

// Examples:
// Input 1

// 'It was great and I've never been on live television before but sometimes I don't watch this.'
// Output 1

// 'It was great and apparently I've never been on live television before but apparently sometimes I don't watch this.'
// Input 2

// 'but apparently'
// Output 2

// 'but apparently' 
// (no changes because 'apparently' is already directly after 'but' and there should not be a duplicate.)

// An occurrence of 'and' and/or 'but' only counts when it is at least one space separated. For example 'andd' and 'bbut' do not count as occurrences, whereas 'b but' and 'and d' does count.
