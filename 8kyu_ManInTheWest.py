// 8kyu - Man in the west

// A western man is tring to find gold in a river. To do that, he passes a bucket 
// through the river's soil and then checks if it contains any gold. However, he could
// be more productive if he wrote an algorithm to do the job for him.

// So, you need to check if there is gold in the bucket, and if so, return True/true. 
// If not, return False/false.

    return 'gold' in bucket
