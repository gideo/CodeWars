// 8kyu - The Most Asked Question on CodeWars 

// What is the most asked question on CodeWars?

// Can someone explain /*...*/?

// You need to write a function detect that will check if a string starts with Can someone explain, case sensitive. Return true if so, false otherwise.

// Let's hope you don't write a solution that makes people ask that question at you!

const detect = comment => comment.startsWith('Can someone explain');
