// 7kyu - Simple Fun #11: Swap Adjacent Bits 

// Task
// You're given an arbitrary 32-bit integer n. Swap each pair of adjacent bits in its binary representation and return the result as a decimal number.

// Example
// For n = 13, the output should be 14

// 1310 = 11012 ~> 11102 = 1410

// For n = 74, the output should be 133

// 7410 = 010010102 ~> 100001012 = 13310

// Note

// the preceding zero written in front of the initial number: since both numbers are 32-bit integers, they have 32 bits in their binary representation. The preceding zeros in other cases don't matter, so they are omitted. Here, however, it does make a difference.

// Input/Output
// [input] integer n

// 0 â‰¤ n < 2^30.

// [output] an integer

let swapAdjacentBits = n => (n & 0xAAAAAAAA) >> 1 | (n & 0x55555555) << 1;
