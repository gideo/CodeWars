// 7kyu - The Speed of Letters 

// Given a string as input, return a new string with each letter pushed to the right by its respective index in the alphabet.

// We all know that A is a slow and Z is a fast letter. This means that Z gets shifted to the right by 25 spaces, A doesn't get shifted at all, and B gets shifted by 1 space.

// You can assume the following things about your input:

// It will only contain uppercase letters from A to Z, no whitespaces or punctuation;
// Input strings will not exceed 100 characters (although your output string might!)
// Note that if 2 or more letters fall onto the same space after shifting, the latest character will be used. For example: "BA" -> " A"

// Examples
// "AZ"   -->  "A                         Z"
// "ABC"  -->  "A B C"
// "ACE"  -->  "A  C  E"
// "CBA"  -->  "  A"
// "HELLOWORLD"  -->  "     E H    DLL   OLO   R  W"
