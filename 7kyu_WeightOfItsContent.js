// 7kyu - Weight of Its Contents

// Welcome to the Mathematics gameshow. I'm your host, Apex Rhombus, and it's time for the lightning round!

// Today we'll talk about a hypothetical bottle. This entire bottle weighs 120 grams. Its contents weigh twice as much as the bottle itself. What, may I ask, do the contents weigh?

// ...Did you guess 80 grams? Correct! Now that you've got that idea, I'm gonna ask you that question in 10 different ways so you'd better get ready!

// Let's make a contentWeight function that takes in two parameters: bottleWeight and scale. This function will return the weight of the contents inside the bottle.

// bottleWeight will be an integer representing the weight of the entire bottle (contents included).

// scale will be a string that you will need to parse. It will tell you how the content weight compares to the weight of the bottle by itself. 2 times larger, 6 times larger, and 15 times smaller would all be valid strings (smaller and larger are the only comparison words).

// The first test case has been filled out for you. Good luck!

function contentWeight(bottleWeight, scale) {
  let s = parseInt(scale);
  return /larger/.test(scale) ? bottleWeight * s / (s+1) : bottleWeight / (s+1);
}
