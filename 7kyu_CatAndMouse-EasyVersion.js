// 7kyu - Cat and Mouse - Easy Version

// You will be given a string (x) featuring a cat 'C' and a mouse 'm'. The rest of the string will be made up of '.'.

// You need to find out if the cat can catch the mouse from it's current position. The cat can jump over three characters. So:

// C.....m returns 'Escaped!' <-- more than three characters between

// C...m returns 'Caught!' <-- as there are three characters between the two, the cat can jump.

function catMouse(x) {
  return x.length <= 5 ? 'Caught!' : 'Escaped!';
}
