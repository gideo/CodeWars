// 7kyu - Sort by Last Char

// Given a string of words (x), you need to return an array of the words, sorted alphabetically by the final character in each.

// If two words have the same last letter, they returned array should show them in the order they appeared in the given string.

// All inputs will be valid.


function last(x){
  return x.split(' ').sort((a, b) => a.charCodeAt(a.length - 1) - b.charCodeAt(b.length - 1));
}
