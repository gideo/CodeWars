// 5kyu - Weight for Weight 

// My friend John and I are members of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)". John is worried because each month a list with the weights of members is published and each month he is the last on the list which means he is the heaviest.

// I am the one who establishes the list so I told him: "Don't worry any more, I will modify the order of the list". It was decided to attribute a "weight" to numbers. The weight of a number will be from now on the sum of its digits.

// For example 99 will have "weight" 18, 100 will have "weight" 1 so in the list 100 will come before 99.

// Given a string with the weights of FFC members in normal order can you give this string ordered by "weights" of these numbers?

// Example:
// "56 65 74 100 99 68 86 180 90" ordered by numbers weights becomes: 

// "100 180 90 56 65 74 68 86 99"
// When two numbers have the same "weight", let us class them as if they were strings (alphabetical ordering) and not numbers:

// 180 is before 90 since, having the same "weight" (9), it comes before as a string.

// All numbers in the list are positive numbers and the list can be empty.

// Notes
// it may happen that the input string have leading, trailing whitespaces and more than a unique whitespace between two consecutive numbers
// For C: The result is freed.
