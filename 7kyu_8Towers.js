// 7kyu - 8 Towers 

// Marcus was spending his last summer day playing chess with his friend Rose.

// Surprisingly, they had a lot of pieces (we suspect Marcus is a part-time thief, but we will leave that aside), and Marcus wondered in how many different positions could 8 towers (rooks) be in the board, without threatening themselves.

// Rose (who was smarter) was wondering if there was any relation between the size of the board, and the number of positions.

// So, you should help!

// Write a function that, given N (positive-only integer) the size of the board , returns the number of different combinations in which these towers can be.

// Example:

// towerCombination(2) returns 2, because only the following possibilities can be achieved.

// | x 0 |
// | 0 x |

// | 0 x |
// | x 0 |
// towerCombination(3) returns 6, because only the following possibilities can be achieved.

// | x 0 0 |
// | 0 x 0 |
// | 0 0 x |

// | x 0 0 |
// | 0 0 x |
// | 0 x 0 |

// | 0 x 0 |
// | x 0 0 |
// | 0 0 x |

// | 0 x 0 |
// | 0 0 x |
// | x 0 0 |

// | 0 0 x |
// | x 0 0 |
// | 0 x 0 |

// | 0 0 x |
// | 0 x 0 |
// | x 0 0 |

function towerCombination(n) {
  let num = 1;
  for(let i = 2; i <= n; i++) 
    num *= i;
  return num;
