// 7kyu - Help the Fruit Guy

// Our fruit guy has a bag of fruit (represented as an array of strings) where some fruits are rotten. He wants to replace all the rotten pieces of fruit with fresh ones. For example, given ["apple","rottenBanana","apple"] the replaced array should be ["apple","banana","apple"]. Your task is to implement a method that accepts an array of strings containing fruits should returns an array of strings where all the rotten fruits are replaced by good ones.

// Notes
// If the array is null/nil/None or empty you should return empty array ([]).
// The rotten fruit name will be in this camelcase (rottenFruit).
// The returned array should be in lowercase.

let removeRotten = arr => (!arr || !arr.length) ? [] : arr.map(a => a.replace(/^rotten/g, '').toLowerCase());
