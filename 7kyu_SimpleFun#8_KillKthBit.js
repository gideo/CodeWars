// 7kyu - Simple Fun #8: Kill K-th Bit

// Task
// In order to stop the Mad Coder evil genius you need to decipher the encrypted message he sent to his minions. The message contains several numbers that, when typed into a supercomputer, will launch a missile into the sky blocking out the sun, and making all the people on Earth grumpy and sad.

// You figured out that some numbers have a modified single digit in their binary representation. More specifically, in the given number n the kth bit from the right was initially set to 0, but its current value might be different. It's now up to you to write a function that will change the kth bit of n back to 0.

// Example
// For n = 37 and k = 3, the output should be 33.

// 3710 = 1001012 ~> 1000012 = 3310

// For n = 37 and k = 4, the output should be 37.

// The 4th bit is 0 already (looks like the Mad Coder forgot to encrypt this number), so the answer is still 37.

// Input/Output
// [input] integer n
// Constraints: 0 ≤ n ≤ 231 - 1.

// [input] integer k
// The 1-based index of the changed bit (counting from the right).

// Constraints: 1 ≤ k ≤ 31.

// [output] an integer
// More Challenge
// Are you a One-Liner? Please try to complete the kata in one line(no test for it) ;-)
