// 6kyu - Vowels Back

// You need to play around with the provided string (s).

// Move consonants forward 9 places through the alphabet. If they pass 'z', start again at 'a'.

// Move vowels back 5 places through the alphabet. If they pass 'a', start again at 'z'.

// Exceptions:

// If the character is 'c' or 'o', move it back 1 place. For 'd' move it back 3, and for 'e', move it back 4.

// If a moved letter becomes 'c', 'o', 'd' or 'e', revert it back to it's original value.

// Provided string will always be lower case, won't be empty and will have no special characters.
