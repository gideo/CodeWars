// 7kyu - Simple Fun #195: Guess Hat Color 

// Task
// Four men, a, b, c and d are standing in a line, one behind another.

// There's a wall between the first three people (a, b and c) and the last one (d).

// a, b and c are lined up in order of height, so that person a can see the backs of b and c, person b can see the back of c, and c can see just the wall.

// There are 4 hats, 2 black and 2 white. Each person is given a hat. None of them can see their own hat, but person a can see the hats of b and c, while person b can see the hat of person c. Neither c nor d can see any hats.

// Once a person figures out their hat's color, they shout it.



// Your task is to return the person who will guess their hat first. You can assume that they will speak only when they reach a correct conclusion.

// Input/Output

// a's hat color ("white" or "black").

// [input] string b
// b's hat color ("white" or "black").

// [input] string c
// c's hat color ("white" or "black").

// [input] string d
// d's hat color ("white" or "black").
