// 7kyu - ScholarStem: Unit 6- Baby count!

// A local birthing center is interested in names!

// They have arrays of all the baby names they see each year, but the lists are sooo long! They donâ€™t know how to calculate how many times one name is used.

// Given an array of names and a specific name string, return the number of times that specific name appears in the array.

// countName( ["Tom","Bob","Harry","Bob"] , "Bob") //should return 2, since "Bob" shows up 2 times in the array

let countName = (anArr, name) => anArr.filter(x=>x==name).length;
