// 7kyu - Coding Meetup #5 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Prepare the count of languages

// You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.

// Your task is to return an object (associative array in PHP) which includes the count of each coding language represented at the meetup.

// For example, given the following input array:

// var list1 = [
//   { firstName: 'Noah', lastName: 'M.', country: 'Switzerland', continent: 'Europe', age: 19, language: 'C' },
//   { firstName: 'Anna', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Liechtenstein', continent: 'Europe', age: 52, language: 'JavaScript' },
//   { firstName: 'Ramon', lastName: 'R.', country: 'Paraguay', continent: 'Americas', age: 29, language: 'Ruby' },
//   { firstName: 'George', lastName: 'B.', country: 'England', continent: 'Europe', age: 81, language: 'C' },
// ];
// your function should return the following object (associative array in PHP):

// { C: 2, JavaScript: 1, Ruby: 1 }
// Notes:

// The order of the languages in the object does not matter.
// The count value should be a valid number.
// The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.

// This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.

function countLanguages(list) {
  let count = {};
  list.forEach(x => count[x.language] = (count[x.language] || 0) + 1);
  return count;
